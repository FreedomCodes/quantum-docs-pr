# Installing the Quantum Development Kit

The Quantum Development Kit can be used either with the Visual Studio 2017 integrated development environment, or with the command line and a development editor such as Visual Studio Code.

> [Install for Visual Studio Code on Windows 10, macOS, or Linux](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.vs-code)

> [!NOTE]
> The Quantum Development Kit requires a 64-bit installation of Windows 10, macOS, or Linux.
> Microsoft's quantum simulator, installed with the Quantum Development Kit, utilizes Advance Vector Extensions (AVX), and thus can run significantly more efficiently on an AVX-enabled CPU.
> The Quantum Development Kit will still run on nonâ€“AVX enabled CPUs, but may not be as efficient.
> Intel processors shipped in Q1 2011 (Sandy Bridge) or later support AVX.
