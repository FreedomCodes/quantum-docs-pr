# Using The Compiler

Q# code is stored as text in files. 
The top-level constructs allowed in a file are user defined types, 
function and operation declarations, and comments.

The Q# compiler will process one or more text files containing any number of 
these constructs and create a single .NET library exposing the functionality 
defined in these text files. 
This library can be referenced within a .NET project and native .NET code in C# or F# 
can then access the functionality represented by the Q# code within the native .NET 
code. 

The compiler functionality is packaged in two different forms:

- As a command line tool which will take some arguments and 
    generate an assembly which can be linked against.
- As a single file generator packaged within a Visual Studio Extension (VSIX) 
    which can act as a custom tool for Q# files in a project, 
    and generate code-behind C# for each file.
    This provides debugging capability within Visual Studio at the Q# language level.

## Compiler Command Line Interface

The command line interface should take a list of Q# input files and the desired name of the output DLL.

    Q#c.exe f1.Q# f2.Q# f3.Q# --output phase.dll
